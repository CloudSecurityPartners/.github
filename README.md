| [Defense-in-Depth Engineering, Blue Team Con 2024](https://github.com/CloudSecurityPartners/skate/blob/1924ce3cc79d9460b87d83da19f35f84e8d8e893/BTC-Defense-in-Depth.pdf) | The 2021 OWASP Top Ten introduced a category “Insecure Design” to focus on risks related to design flaws. In this talk, we will focus on techniques we can use to build defense-in-depth software. What can we do to proactively architect software to be more resilient to attacks? What type of findings may not be discovered via automated static analysis? How can we design our software to be more friendly during incident response scenarios? Throughout this talk, we will focus on identifying often-overlooked architectural anti-patterns and vulnerabilities to be on the lookout for. We will source code to analyze patterns for improvement in both real-world applications as well as intentionally vulnerable applications. Engineers will leave this talk with a solid understanding of defense-in-depth software architecture and design. Security engineers or consultants can expect to leave with an increased understanding of insecure design patterns and vulnerabilities. |
| [60 Minutes to Hack: AWS](presentations/cactus-con-2024.pdf) | Gone in 60 Minutes – A one-hour checklist for pentesting AWS. The detections team is hot on your trail, and your access will be cut in 1-hour – what do you do? This talk will lay out the foundations for red teaming an AWS account in an extremely time-boxed manner. We will identify tools and techniques for exfiltrating data, maintaining persistence, and causing noise. The emphasis of this talk will be laying out things that can actually be accomplished in 1-hour. After all, time limits everything. Attendees will walk away from this talk with a functional and prioritized checklist that they can use during red team operations. |
